## Files list:
* *daily_reports/total_cases.csv:* Data from the published daily summaries.
Notice that until 2020-03-15, IMoH did not include the number of recovered cases.
I've translated קל-בינוני-קשה to mild-serious-critical (better translations are welcome).

* *daily_reports/total_tests.csv:* Data from the periodic reports of total tests done.

* *daily_reports/daily_tests_*.csv:* Data from the graphs with tests total/pos/neg.
Some of these graphs contradict each other. I put the latest readable data for each day In here.

* *other_reports/\*_daily_test_results.csv:* Data of daily positive and negative tests. According to the graph, this is using the date of the lab-result.
