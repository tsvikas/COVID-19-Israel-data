# COVID-19 Israel data
Unofficial Github with the data published by The Israel Ministry of Health, regarding The Coronavirus disease

Data source: https://t.me/MOHreport

The data is publiclly published, and I don't own it. I might make mistakes when typing it, please verify as needed.

## Files list:
* *daily_report/total_cases.csv:* Data from the published daily summaries.
Notice that until 2020-03-15, IMoH did not include the number of recovered cases.
I've translated קל-בינוני-קשה to mild-serious-critical (better translations are welcome).

* *daily_report/total_tests.csv:* Data from the periodic reports of total tests done.

* *graphs/\*.daily_results:* Data of daily positive and negative tests. According to the graph, this is using the date of the lab-result.
